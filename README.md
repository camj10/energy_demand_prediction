# Energy Consumption Prediction Using Artificial Intelligence

This project is part of the **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering** program. It explores the relationship between energy consumption and artificial intelligence through a predictive modeling approach. The goal is to forecast energy demand based on historical and seasonal data using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.

## Features

- **Energy Consumption Prediction**: Uses historical and seasonal variables to predict energy demand.
- **Neural Network Implementation**: Developed using PyTorch for efficient training and evaluation.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Incorporates bio-inspired algorithms like Simulated Annealing and Particle Swarm Optimization to enhance model performance.
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data normalization and sequence preparation.
- **Visualization**: Employs Matplotlib for plotting results, including loss trends during training and model evaluation comparisons.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Main programming language for model development.
- **PyTorch**: For designing and training the LSTM neural network.
- **SciPy**: For Simulated Annealing optimization.
- **PySwarm**: For Particle Swarm Optimization.
- **NumPy** and **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preparation.
- **Matplotlib**: For graphical representations of results.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Processes historical and seasonal data from the dataset.
   - Normalizes features to improve model training.

2. **Model Training**: 
   - Trains the LSTM network on prepared sequences.
   - Evaluates performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

3. **Optimization**: 
   - Enhances model parameters through bio-inspired algorithms (Simulated Annealing and Particle Swarm Optimization).

4. **Evaluation**: 
   - Compares model predictions against actual energy demand.
   - Visualizes results with plots to highlight prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effective integration of artificial intelligence and energy management. By leveraging predictive modeling, it successfully forecasts energy consumption and achieves its objectives, as evidenced by the comparison between predicted and actual values.
